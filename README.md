# abelian-sand-pile-model
Implementation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model with Go and Raylib5

to run: you need to have nix installed on your system, after run `nix develop` which puts you in a bash shell with all dependencies, then just run `go run .` and there you have it. Optionally you can use `wgo clear :: go run .` to rerun the program on each save.
